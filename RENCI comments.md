## RENCI comments / additions:

* Introduce ISEES S2I2 briefly: http://isees.nceas.ucsb.edu/ 
* Introduce WSSI S2I2 briefly: http://www.renci.org/research/water-science-software-institute/ 
* Emphasize the bi-coastal nature of the training in a way that the NSF will really take note of what we’re doing.  Without explicitly stating that ISEES and WSSI will eventually merge, hint at it such that it is clear to the NSF that a merger makes sense, and impresses them that we’ve each (i.e. ISEES and WSSI) taken the initiative to do what’s in the best interest of the community, and S2I2 program.

Audience:

* The Press Release is intended to attract specifically graduate students, postdocs, and professionals (e.g. faculty, researchers) to apply to be accepted to a seat for this training.  There will be approximately 20 students in UCSB, and 20 students in Chapel Hill.  Need to mention that all housing/meal/travel fees will be paid for students, and certain fees will be offset for postdocs and professionals.
* Stan has said (paraphrasing) that this training is a very unique opportunity for students and researchers to become versed in sustainable software practices.  This next part is harder to describe, but Stan says that, sort of like attending intense 3-week MBA executive training at Kenan (that is my analogy, not Stan’s), that one will build life-long relationships at this training.  The implication is that, since the training opportunity is rare, and is excellent, that this will propel this group of 20 students at each site (Santa Barbara and Chapel Hill) ahead in their careers, and ahead of colleagues who don’t take the training, and the career paths of these 20 students will intersect serendipitously and/or intentionally for the rest of their lives always remembering back to how valuable/impactful/meaningful this training was in their careers.
